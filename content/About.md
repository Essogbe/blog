# About Me

I'm **Romuald AMEGBEDJI** â€” AI student, curious mind, and passionate about everything related to Artificial Intelligence and tech.

Currently finishing my Bachelor's in Artificial Intelligence at the Institut de Formation et de Recherche en Informatique ([IFRI](https://ifri-uac.bj)), University of Abomey-Calavi, Benin.

**Currently interning at [Etihuku](https://etihuku.com) as a Machine Learning Engineer**, working on AI solutions that address African challenges at scale.

My journey blends learning, hands-on projects, community engagement, and a strong drive to make a meaningful impact.

## What drives me 

I'm fascinated by AI as a whole, but what excites me most is **AI in production** â€” where models meet the real world.

I'm constantly learning about **MLOps**, **DevOps**, and everything related to deploying, monitoring, and scaling AI solutions.

## My commitments 

**[Etihuku](https://etihuku.com)** â€” Currently interning as a **Machine Learning Engineer**,learning and  developing AI solutions that tackle large-scale African problems.
